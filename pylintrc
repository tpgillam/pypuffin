[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"

[BASIC]

# Regular expression which should match function or class names which do not require a docstring
no-docstring-rgx = __.*__|main

# Regular expression which should only match correct variable names
variable-rgx = [a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,50}$

# Regular expression matching correct attribute names
attr-rgx=[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,50}$


[DESIGN]

# Maximum number of arguments for a function / method
max-args = 10


[FORMAT]

# Maximum number of characters on a single line.
max-line-length = 120


[TYPECHECK]

# List of module names for which member attributes should not be checked
# (useful for modules/projects where namespaces are manipulated during runtime
# and thus existing member attributes cannot be deduced by static analysis. It
# supports qualified module names, as well as Unix pattern matching.
